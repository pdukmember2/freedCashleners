If you're in the market for a bad credit personal loan, you may have noticed that many lenders will offer to loan you money only if the loan is secured. What this means is that you need to put up collateral--something of value, like you home equity, or stocks you hold--that the lender can sell if you should default on the loan.

Given that you are a poor credit risk, this policy makes a great deal of sense from the lenders' point of view. But you may find a bad credit personal loan available even if you lack the collateral to secure it. This sort of loan usually requires that you have someone cosign the loan with you, agreeing to be responsible for the payments if you fail to make them. The cosigner, naturally, will have to be someone with a good credit record.
